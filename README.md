# Blended-Teaching-Survey

This repository contains the analysis of the "Blended Teaching Experience: Student Satisfaction Survey". The survey was designed to gather feedback from students on their experience with blended learning, including both online and face-to-face components.

## Data Collection

The data for this survey was collected using Google Forms, ensuring confidentiality and anonymity for all respondents. The survey included sections on:

- **Demographics** (program year, comfort with technology, gender, major, current role, and preferred communication media).
- **Satisfaction Ratings** (using a 5-point Likert scale to assess various aspects of blended learning).

## Data Preparation and Wrangling

Before visualizing the data in Power BI, several data wrangling steps were performed to prepare the dataset:

✅ **Unpivoted Columns** – To transform wide-formatted data into a more analysis-friendly long format.

✅ **Split Columns** – Some multi-response fields were split into separate columns for better analysis.

✅ **Added Custom Columns** – Created new calculated columns as needed for analysis and visualization.

✅ **Replaced Values** – Standardized and cleaned data entries to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Power BI was used to analyze and visualize the survey data. The dashboards include:

- Demographic breakdowns (e.g., program year, comfort with technology).
- Satisfaction ratings for various aspects of the blended learning experience.
- Insights into preferred communication media and student feedback.
